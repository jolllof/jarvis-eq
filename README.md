A simple yet powerful AI project that can help you learn top Python AI libraries is a Chatbot with Sentiment Analysis.

## Project: AI Chatbot with Sentiment Analysis

# What Youâ€™ll Learn:
Natural Language Processing (NLP) with spaCy or NLTK
Machine Learning with Scikit-learn
Deep Learning with TensorFlow or PyTorch (optional)
Sentiment Analysis with VADER (NLTK) or TextBlob

# How It Works:
The chatbot receives user input.
It processes the text and determines sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral).
It responds accordingly using a simple rule-based or AI-powered model.

# Libraries to Use:
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) for text processing & sentiment analysis
spaCy for advanced NLP (optional)
Scikit-learn for training simple AI models (optional)
TensorFlow/PyTorch if you want to add deep learning capabilities
